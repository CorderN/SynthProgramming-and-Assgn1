# SynthProgramming-Intro-Assgn-1

Study the 2.1 Intro to Synthesis and 2.2 Programming Tutorials.  They will help
you understand how the code in 2.3 Composing Process Tutorial works.  Use the
process by extending the code in the 2.3 using UGens that interest you found
in the Tour of the UGens.  Chapter 2 in Gentle Introduction to SuperCollider will
help you be introducing the Pattern library for sequencing.  Use examples from
this chapter in making your own Pdefs that you combine into a short composition to
play in class next week!
